Step 1:
  Created a new repository.
Step 2:
  Created a python linear regression algorithm file.
Step 3:
  Went to git actions, configured the python file, added libraries like numpy, pandas and scikit-learn and created the yaml file.
Step 4:
  It tested the linear_regression.py file, and found an error that then bracket was missing.
Step 5:
  Then went back to the py file, and corrected the code.
Step 6:
  Created a polynomial_regression.py file.
Step 7:
  The yaml file went into the action and found no errors in the polynomial_regression.py file.
